# Tasmania 2018

We returned back to Tasmania on 1-5 May 2018 and mainly visited the [Freycinet National Park](http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/index.aspx?base=336) and Hobart. Although I had sprained my left patellar tendon a few weeks prior to the trip, I was able to walk around without too much difficulty by the time we arrived at Tasmania (thank goodness). The trip was really enjoyable and we were very lucky because a week later Hobart was deluged by wild weather and strong rains and Macquarie St (where we stayed) was flooded!

repositories into a single seamless website.
